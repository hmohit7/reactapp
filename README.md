In this Project,a full-featured web application which emphasizes lighting-fast load times and live updates. here I learn how to use React.js to build a front-end web application, and use Browserify and Gulp to load the app isomorphically in Node.js.  I also learn how to implement Express for handling HTTP requests, and how to integrate Mongoose with Express for fast and expressive long-term data storage.
